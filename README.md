# SalaryCalculator
A simple Salary calculator (windows console app - vb.net)

This console application takes two defined user inputs (gross salary, pay frequency) and calculates Super, Taxable Income, Deductions, net income and pay amount).
Along with main module, only one class (Calculations.vb) is used, with calculations performed within a single method.
 
Figures are currently hardcoded (percentages/tiers for each item) for purposes of this assignment, but in future could be handled by for example, xml or json file.
Doing so could allow the user a 3rd input eg. 'Enter a Financial year', with rates/percentages for each specific year to be calculated.
